<h3 align="center">Gloo Kubernetes Upstream Discovery Service</h3>
<BR>

Gloo is a function gateway built on top of the [Envoy Proxy](https://www.Envoyproxy.io). Gloo provides a unified entry point
for access to all services and serverless functions, translating from any interface spoken by a client to any interface
spoken by a backend. Gloo aggregates REST APIs and events calls from clients, "glueing" together services in-cluster, 
out of cluster, across clusters, along with any provider of serverless functions.

Here you will find the source files for the Kubernetes Upstream Discovery Service. The k8s upstream discovery service is a
discovery service that runs outside of Gloo, discovering Kubernetes services and creating Gloo upstreams from them. The 
discovery service is an add-on for Gloo to facilitate easier routing and-self service for Gloo clients.

See our [documentation](https://gloo.solo.io) for more information about the Gloo discovery services.
