### What you'll need

If you haven't already deployed Gloo and the example swagger service on kubernetes, [go back to the first tutorial](1.md)

Now that we've seen the traditional routing functionality of Gloo (i.e. API-to-service), let's try doing some function routing.

Let's take a look at the upstream that was created for our petstore service:

         glooctl upstream get default-petstore-8080
         
         functions:
         - name: addPet
           spec:
             body: '{"id": {{pet.id}},"name": "{{pet.name}}","tag": "{{pet.tag}}"}'
             headers:
               :method: POST
             path: /api/pets
         - name: deletePet
           spec:
             body: ""
             headers:
               :method: DELETE
             path: /api/pets/{{id}}
         - name: findPetById
           spec:
             body: ""
             headers:
               :method: GET
             path: /api/pets/{{id}}
         - name: findPets
           spec:
             body: ""
             headers:
               :method: GET
             path: /api/pets?tags={{tags}}&limit={{limit}}
         ...
         
We can see there are functions on our `default-petstore-8080` upstream. These functions were populated automatically by
the `function-discovery` pod. You can see the function discovery service in action by running `k logs -l gloo=function-discovery`

The [function spec](TODO) you see on the functions listed above belongs to the [transformation plugin](TODO). This powerful
plugin configures Gloo's [request/response transformation Envoy filter](TODO) to perform transform requests to the structure expected by
our petstore app.

In a nutshell, this plugin takes [Inja templates](TODO) for HTTP body, headers, and path as its parameters (documented in the [plugin spec](TODO))
and transforms incoming requests from those templates. Parameters for these templates can come from the request body (if it's JSON), or they
can come from [parameters specified in the extensions on a route](TODO).

Let's see how this plugin works by creating some routes to these functions in the next section.

### Steps

1. Start by creating the route with `glooctl`:

        glooctl route create \
          --path-exact /petstore/findPet \
          --upstream default-petstore-8080 \
          --function findPetById 

    Notice that, unlike the previous tutorial, we're passing an extra argument to `glooctl`: `--function findPetById`.

    Let's go ahead and test the route using `curl`:
    
        export GATEWAY_ADDR=$(kubectl get po -l gloo=ingress -n gloo-system -o 'jsonpath={.items[0].status.hostIP}'):$(kubectl get svc ingress -n gloo-system -o 'jsonpath={.spec.ports[?(@.name=="http")].nodePort}')
        export GATEWAY_URL=http://$GATEWAY_ADDR
            
        curl ${GATEWAY_URL}/petstore/findPet

        bad request: Did not found json element: id
 
    What's that? An error? Try again with `curl -v` and you'll see a `400 Bad Request` status on the response.
    
    Looking again at the function `findPetById`, you'll notice the template wants a variable called `id`:
    
         - name: findPetById
           spec:
             body: ""
             headers:
               :method: GET
             path: /api/pets/{{id}}
             
1. Try the request again, but now add a JSON body with the parameter specified by name:

        curl ${GATEWAY_URL}/petstore/findPet -d '{"id": 1}
    
        {"id":1,"name":"Dog","status":"available"}

    Great! We just called our first function through Gloo. 
    
    

1. Parameters can also come from headers. Let's tell Gloo to look for `id` in a custom header.

   Let's edit the route directly on our virtual host with `kubectl`:
        
        kubectl edit -n gloo-system virtualhost default
        
    Brings up the editor:
    
        # Please edit the object below. Lines beginning with a '#' will be ignored,
        # and an empty file will abort the edit. If an error occurs while saving this file will be
        # reopened with the relevant failures.
        #
        apiVersion: gloo.solo.io/v1
        kind: VirtualHost
        metadata:
          clusterName: ""
          creationTimestamp: 2018-03-05T21:49:23Z
          generation: 0
          name: default
          namespace: gloo-system
          resourceVersion: "15494"
          selfLink: /apis/gloo.solo.io/v1/namespaces/gloo-system/virtualhosts/default
          uid: 10f5a345-20bf-11e8-80c7-3c42d159c69c
        spec:
          routes:
          - request_matcher:
              path_exact: /petstore/findPet
            single_destination:
              function:
                function_name: findPetById
                upstream_name: default-petstore-8080
          - prefix_rewrite: /api/pets
            request_matcher:
              path_exact: /petstore/list
            single_destination:
              upstream:
                name: default-petstore-8080
        status:
          state: 1
    
    We need to add an `extension` to this route that tells Gloo how to grab template parameters from the request.
    Change the first route from
    
        - request_matcher:
            path_exact: /petstore/findPet
          single_destination:
            function:
              function_name: findPetById
              upstream_name: default-petstore-8080
    
    to the following
     
        - request_matcher:
            path_exact: /petstore/findPet
          single_destination:
            function:
              function_name: findPetById
              upstream_name: default-petstore-8080
          extensions:
            parameters:
              headers:
                x-pet: '{id}'
                     
    Now Gloo knows to look for the parameter named `id` in a header called `pet`.
    
    Save the edited file and try `curl` again, this time with the new header:
    
        curl ${GATEWAY_URL}/petstore/findPet -H "x-pet: 1"
    
        {"id":1,"name":"Dog","status":"available"}
