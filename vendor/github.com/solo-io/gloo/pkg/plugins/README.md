Plugins
----
Gloo's configuration language is highly extensible through the use of plugins. 
Here you will find the source files for the Gloo plugins maintained by the core Gloo development team.
Developers who wish to write their own plugins can look here for examples of where to start.

Plugin-specific APIs and detailed documentation can be found in our [documentation](https://gloo.solo.io).
